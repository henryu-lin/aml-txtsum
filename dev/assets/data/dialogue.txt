Henry: Hey, is Nate coming over to watch the movie tonight?
Kevin: Yea, he said he'll be arriving a bit later at around seven since he gets off of work at six. Have you taken out the garbage yet?
Henry: Oh I forgot. I'll do that once I'm finished with my assignment for my math class.
Kevin: Yea, you should take it out as soon as possible. And also, Nate is bringing his girlfriend.
Henry: Nice, I'm really looking forward to seeing them again.

Danny: Hello sir, do you have some donuts to sell? I am looking to buy a dozen donuts.
Hannah: Excuse me, I am a woman not a sir.
Danny: Oh my bad!
Hannah: Anyways, yes we do sell donuts. What kind of donuts would you like?
Danny: I'll have twelve chocolate donuts.
Hannah: Ok, give me a minute to prepare them for you. Please have a seat over there while you wait.
