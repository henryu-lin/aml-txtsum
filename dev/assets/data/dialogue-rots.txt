Obi-wan: This time we will do it together.
Anakin: I was about to say that.
Palpatine: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
Obi-wan: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
Dooku: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
Obi-wan: You won't get away this time, Dooku.
Dooku: I've been looking forward to this.
Anakin: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
Dooku: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

Mace: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
Anakin: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair... I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
Mace: Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Anakin: Forgive me, Master.

Palpatine: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.
Mace: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
Palpatine: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
Mace: The Senate will decide your fate.
Palpatine: I am the Senate!
Mace: Not yet!
Palpatine: It's treason, then.

Obi-wan: You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now... until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Anakin: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
Obi-wan: Your new Empire?
Anakin: Don't make me kill you.
Obi-wan: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic... to democracy.
Anakin: If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
Obi-wan: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
Anakin: You will try.

Obi-wan: I have failed you, Anakin. I have failed you.
Anakin: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over...
Obi-wan: Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
Anakin: From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
Obi-wan: Well, then you are lost!
Anakin: This is the end for you, My Master.
Obi-wan: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
Anakin: You underestimate my power!
Obi-wan: Don't try it.
