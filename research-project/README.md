# Microsoft CELA Sustainability Grant: AzureML Cost/Power/Carbon
Fine-tuning models is a difficult task. Even with expert knowledge, models are often developed through trial and error. Approaches that alleviate fine-tuning difficulty would help decrease the number of trials and failuresâ€”thereby reducing the total carbon emissions generated from the fine-tuning process.

This project attempts to provide several fine-tuning tips/insights and benchmarks for users to use as reference for model selection/development or other research. It will also provide a sample for users to perform their own experiments and track resource usage/carbon metrics.
