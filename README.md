# Microsoft GreenAI (NLP Text Summarization)

Fine-tuning is a difficult task, and models are mostly developed through trial and error even with expert knowledge. Lowering the fine-tuning learning curve would reduce the number of trials and failures, thereby reducing the total carbon emission generated from the fine-tuning process. This project attempts to provide several benchmarks and fine-tuning tips/insights for users to use as reference for model selection/development and/or other research. It will also provide a sample for users to perform their own experiments and track resource usage/carbon metrics.
